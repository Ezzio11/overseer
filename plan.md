# Why I created FlickBall

I've been supporting FC Barcelona since 2015. I fell in love not with the team that won the big silverware---but the team that had principles and would die by them.

In 2021, things started to change a little bit. Not even the 8-2 loss VS Bayern in 2020 would make me go away, but in 2021? It felt like the team was going nowhere---even though we desperately needed change (IYKYK). And so, I decided to quit watching football altogether and focus on my most important academic year in my life.

Fast forward to 2024, and I'm back! and we JUST lost the Supercopa de Espana against Real Madrid 4-1. What a return gift.

I kept believing, but it was so clear: this team was going nowhere yet again, after all those years. Board changed, coaches changed, players changed. We signed one of the greatest strikers in history (Lewa) and still we can't sustain ANYTHING?!

Enter: Hans Dieter Flick.
Same board, same players (plus Olmo), new era.

Xavi was convinced what he achieved was as good as it gets given the club circumstances. Flick said nah, WE BALL.

And boy, ball he did.

Changing the relic of a formation that is 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1, making full use of the contrast in Lamine, Raphinha and Pedri abilities. And boom..

4-0 against Real Madrid, 5-2 against the same Madrid, and then a 3-2, and then a 4-3... total domination is an understatement. That was the same Madrid side that humiliated us for 4 straight games with Xavi, and they added Kylian Mbappe..

4-1 against Bayern, 4-2 against Atletico, 7-0 against Valladolid, 7-1 against Valencia. It didn't matter who you were. If you dare, you'll get blasted, _relentlessly_.

And so, I decided to show my appreciation for the man (and team) whom I think for restoring my passion for football again. Winning LaLiga, Copa del Rey, Supercopa de Espana was nice. Losing the UCL hurt---a lot. But none of it mattered as much as finally Futbol Club Barcelona being a bunch of warriors with soul again.

# What I did

I'm a full-stack web developer, but I'm also a statistics major first, and so the idea was clear to me: collect data, analyze data, then present it the best way you know.

I first went with the usual in sports analytics: minimalist, clean glassmorphism.
It looked good, looked safe, looked boring.

So I decided to go in the complete opposite direction: messy sketchbook/notebook aesthetic.
It just kept evolving so naturally, until I hit the comic book style. This one lingered.

What first started as a clean overview of the Flick dominance of Real Madrid (right! I forgot to mention this project was a JUST elclasico in Hansi's era.), transformed into a FlickVerse.

Thank you, Hansi.
And thank you, dear reader, for reading. I hope to have made you feel something, because that's the goal. Not to show stats, but to tell a story.

I'm a big fan of sofascore. Have been since 2018/2019, and they're one of the many odd reasons why I majored in statistics. But as much as I like them, I don't like how black-boxy their player rating algorithm is. I understand that it's because its their "secret sauce", but as a guy who studies interpertability for a living, it didn't sit right with me.

So I went about developing our very own "FlickBall Index"---or "FBI" for short (I know...).
100% transparent, it measures how good the player is to the Flick system. Giving high weighting to high press, carries to the final third, good positioning, etc. as opposed to the usual "goals, assists, chance creation, and so on.."
